V1.0 - 11/06/18 - Qian:

  1) need a seperate 'view menu page'
  
  2) in 'menu page', 
      - changed the type-in qty to selection box. System requiements need to be udpated accordingly.
      - button #3 & #5 is not working now.
      - total price of food #6 is not calculated correctly.
      - each food price is supposed to read from database. Currently they are static in front end.
      - might want to rename all variables, i.e. qtyInput01, qty01, calQty01, temp, test, etc.
      
  3) in 'customer landing page',
      - pic size needs to be identical
      
  4) 'delivery address page' and 'order confirmation page' need .js file
